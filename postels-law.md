These are a few notes on what is known as _Postel's Law_ or the _robustness principle_. The law goes as follows:

> Be lenient in what you accept and be strict in what you put out

**TL;DR**:

* The _robustness principle_ is known as _Postel's law_ after Jon Postel wrote it in an early specification of the internet protocol in 1980
