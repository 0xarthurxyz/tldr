## Great Interview with @mevintern

From [#29: Interview with a Searcher â€“ with MEV Senpai and Hasu + transcript](https://uncommoncore.co/29-interview-with-a-searcher-with-mev-senpai-and-hasu/)

> I sat down with MEV Senpai, one of the top searchers in Ethereum. He gave us the unique inside perspective of someone who finds and captures MEV himself. The result was a long & intense convo, one of the best Iâ€™ve had in a while.

Here's a list of topics covered:

* The **structure** and **actors** of the MEV game
* What is searching, how can you learn it, what **edges** exist
* Intro to **private relays** and **transaction bundles**
* The role of **Flashbots** in DEX trading
* short-term **reorgs** in Ethereum

*What's MEV?*
> Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. --- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/miner-extractable-value-mev)

For context, MEV is one of many arbitrage opportunities on blockchains. Here is an example of what might be the biggest on-chain arbitrage of all time.
