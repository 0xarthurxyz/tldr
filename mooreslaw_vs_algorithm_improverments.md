## TL;DR

- about **half** of algorithm families had YoY improvements that were **equal to or larger** than the much-touted gains from **Mooreâ€™s Law**
- The single biggest change that the authors observed came when an algorithm family transitioned from **exponential** to **polynomial** complexity.
- Hardware improvement from Mooreâ€™s Law happens **smoothly** over time, and for algorithms the gains come in **steps** that are usually large but infrequent.
