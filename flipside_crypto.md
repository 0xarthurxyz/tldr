## Community-driven Analytics

_What's [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/)?_

Flipside crypto is a website that

> puts pre-modeled and labeled blockchain data in the hands of communities. Through dashboard and visualization tools, as well as auto-generated API endpoints, data analysts can easily create queries that answer any question.

_Who does [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/) work with?_

> Flipside works directly with leading crypto projects to reward on-demand analytics through structured bounty programs.
> Questions sourced directly from the community provide insight into what communities care about as well as analytics needed to drive ecosystem engagement and growth.

(ðŸ’¡) This is similar to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/home), which is a website where you can create and publish crypto dashboards using blockchain data (e.g. [ENS](https://dune.xyz/makoto/-eth-registration-funnel)).

_Why does this matter?_

The Terra ecosystem is crowdsourcing data analytics using Flipside Crypto.

_How do they do this?_

If I understand correctly, they [delegated](https://www.notion.so/teamflipside/Flipside-Bounties-for-Terra-77f67a879b124a72a984a236b0428620) 500k LUNA to Flipside crypto to run a validator node on the Terra network. They yield generated from this validator node is used to pay bounties to users that submit dashboards that answer custom analystics questions.
