Template in text version belowðŸ‘‡

**Insight**:

* How well do you **understand** your `product`, `users`, `customers`, and `domain`?

* How well do you **translate** this understanding into compelling `strategy` and product `proposals`?

* How well do you **translate** them into `goals`, `priorities`, and `plans` to stir action?

**Execution**:

* How well did you **deliver** on your `highest priority goals` (i.e. your P0 goals) for the evaluation period?

* How well did you **communicate** and **collaborate** with your `team members`, cross-functional `partners`, and `other teams`?

* How **consistently** does the overall `quality` of product features shipped by your team meet the companyâ€™s bar?

**Impact**:

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `leading indicators`?
(e.g., beta adoption, customer satisfaction, key ships, feature usage growth, user experience metrics, etc.)

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `lagging indicators`?
(e.g., revenue, user growth, margin, cost savings, customer upsell, large customer deployments, etc.)

* How did you **make** your team, org, or the company `better`?
