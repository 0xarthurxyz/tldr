## Building a Personal Monopoly

From "[Building a Personal Monopoly](https://visualizevalue.com/blogs/feed/building-a-personal-monopoly)".

**TL;DR**:

- competence, curiosity, and character combined are rare
- Having all 3 doesn't matter unless you can communicate well
- Unfortunately communicating is hard and packaging intangible ideas results in translation losses
- Try to combat this loss with design and writing
- To create a category of 1 combine:
  - **competence**, **curiosity**, and **character**, with
  - minimal **translation loss** using **design** and **writing**.
